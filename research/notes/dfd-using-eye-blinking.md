Deep vision algo proposed.

- we propose a new approach to detect Deepfakes generated through the generative adversarial network (GANs) model via an algorithm called DeepVision to analyze a significant change in the pattern of blinking, which is a voluntary and spontaneous action that does not require conscious effort.
- The proposed method called DeepVision is implemented as a measure to verify an anomaly based on the period, repeated number, and elapsed eye blink time when eye blinks were continuously repeated within a very short period of time. 
- DeepVision accurately detected Deepfakes in seven out of eight types of videos (87.5% accuracy rate)
