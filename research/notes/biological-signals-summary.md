Summary of [[dfd_using_biological_features_survey.pdf|this]] research article
## Introduction
Explained:
1. What is deep fake?
2. How are they generated?
3. Evolution of deep fakes.
4. Rise of need for detecting deep fakes.
5. Malicious usage of deep fake technology and it's after effects
6. Detection of collapsing of pixels and other abnormalities to detect deep fakes
7. Evolution of GANs discriminators to dodge the abnormality validations and failure of detection of collapsing of pixels.
### GAN
we see two different neural networks: 
- the generator 
- the discriminator

The generators job is to fool the discriminator. The more accurate discriminator is the better generator will be.

### Background: overview of Deepfake
Explained the causes of deepfakes creation in the first place.

## Statement of Problem
Aim is to study the Deepfake detection methods that employ biological features in detection. 

Broadly, study is on five biological features:
- Eyebrow
- Eye blinking
- Eye movement
- Ear and mouth movement
- Heartbeat detection
